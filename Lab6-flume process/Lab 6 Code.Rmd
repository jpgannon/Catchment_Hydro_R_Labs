##This is just a shell of an RMD file for you to start with so I can have access to your code.
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

#if "dat" is your dataframe
#and it has columns "date" "time" and "stage"

#to combine date and time
dat$datetime <- paste(dat$date, dat$time)

#to convert "datetime" to posix
dat$datetime <- strptime(dat$datetime, format = "%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S")
dat$datetime <- as.POSIXct(dat$datetime)
                         
#if you created a vector called Q when you created discharge
#add it to your "dat" dataframe by:
dat <- cbind(dat, Q)

#OR
dat$Q <- Q

#OR
dat <- cbind.data.frame(dat, Q)

#plot
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = datetime, y = Q))+
  geom_line()

#in console
data$datetime
data$Q













```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
