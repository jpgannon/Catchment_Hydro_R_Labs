# Catchment_Hydro_R_Labs

These labs were developed for an upper-level undergraduate catchment hydrology course. Pre-requisites were soils and hydrology, hydrogeology, and/or watershed management.

The shell R/rmd files were created in rstudio.cloud, with data and libraries pre-loaded, depending on how far we were in the semester. Students cloned those rstudio.cloud environments, completed the assignments, and turned in knit rmd files containing their code, answers to questions, and plots.
